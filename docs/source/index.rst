Paramak-neutronics
==================

Paramak-neutronics adds support for DAGMC Openmc based simulations using geometry
generating using the `Paramak <https://github.com/fusion-energy/paramak>`_

History
-------

The package was originally conceived by Jonathan Shimwell to help automate
neutronics simulations of fusion reactors.

The Paramak-neutronics source code is distributed with a permissive open-source
license (MIT) and is available from the GitHub repository 
`https://github.com/fusion-energy/paramak <https://github.com/fusion-energy/paramak>`_


Features
--------

In general Paramak-neutronics takes a Paramak.Reactor or Paramak.Shape object and
allows tallies to be easily added and processes the results for ease of access.

The Paramak supports automated neutronics model creation and subsequent
simulation. 

The neutronics models created are DAGMC models and are therefore compatible 
with a suite of neutronics codes (MCNP, Fluka, Geant4, OpenMC).

The automated simulations supported within the paramak are via OpenMC however
one could also carry out simulations in other neutronics codes using the
dagmc.h5m file created. Moab can be used to inspect the dagmc.h5 file and file
the material tag names.

.. code-block:: bash

   mbsize -ll dagmc.h5m | grep 'mat:'

The creation of the dagmc.h5m file can be carried out via three routes.

Option 1. Use of `PyMoab <https://bitbucket.org/fathomteam/moab>`_ which is
distributed with MOAB. Thus method can not imprint or merge the surfaces of the
geometry that touch. Therefore this method should only be used for single
components or components that touch on flat surfaces. Curved surfaces converted
via this method can potentially overlap and cause errors with the particle
tracking.

Option 2. Use of `Trelis <https://www.coreform.com/products/trelis/>`_ by
Coreform along with the DAGMC
`plugin <https://svalinn.github.io/DAGMC/install/plugin.html>`_ / This method
can support imprinting and merging of shared surfaces between components and is
therefore suitable for converting more complex CAD geometry to the PyMoab
method.

Option 3. Use of the `PPP <https://github.com/ukaea/parallel-preprocessor>`_
and `OCC_Faceter <https://github.com/makeclean/occ_faceter/>`_ . This option
has not yet been fully demonstrated but is partly included to test the
promising new method.

To create a model it is also necessary to define the source and the materials
used. 

For fusion simulations you might want to used the parametric-plasma-source
`Git repository <https://github.com/open-radiation-sources/parametric-plasma-source>`_ 

Details of the Neutronics Material Maker are available from the
`documentation <https://neutronics-material-maker.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_ 
and the `source code repository <https://github.com/ukaea/neutronics_material_maker>`_
. However openmc.Materials can also be used directly.

The `OpenMC workshop <https://github.com/ukaea/openmc_workshop>`_ also has
some Paramak with DAGMC and OpenMC based tasks that might be of interest.
